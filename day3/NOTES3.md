# Day 3: Binary Diagnostic

For the third problem we work with bits in binary numbers and convert back to
decimal (base10) representation.

In Part One we count the most and least common bits in each position of the
binary numbers then finally convert the bits back to decimal to get the gamma
and epsilon rates.

In Part Two we follow a similar counting logic but after counting at each bit
position we discard candidates that no longer follow the dominant bit until we
are only left with one candidate left. With this single candidate we again
convert it to decimal to get the oxygen and co2 ratings.
